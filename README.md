# Crud_Section
"Notes" project using PHP, CRUD operations manage note entries. Here's a brief description:

Create: Use a form to add new notes to the database. PHP processes the form submission, inserting the note’s content and metadata into the database.

Read: Retrieve and display existing notes from the database. PHP queries the database and presents the notes in a user-friendly format, such as a list or table.

Update: Modify existing notes. PHP provides an edit form that allows users to change the note’s content, which is then updated in the database.

Delete: Remove notes from the database. PHP handles the deletion request, removing the selected note’s record from the database.
